### Overview

**Problem & solution:** There was no student laptop startup page, and the school leadership wanted one. So, I used basic web programming to design the following website, which incorporates features that were most desired by students. Currently the website is deployed on ~25% of the student laptops at the school.

### Features

In addition to the buttons and links visible in the above screenshot, students can search through the school's directory of teachers. The data is periodically mined from the school website via. a NodeJS script.
