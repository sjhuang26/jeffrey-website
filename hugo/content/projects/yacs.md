YACS is the main scheduling tool of RPI (a local university), developed over multiple years before I joined the team.

In 9th grade, the project was much larger than anything I had helped with before. While it was a very good learning experience, I found it challenging to contribute to new features at the time because of an overall lack of experience/knowledge. This summer though, I feel that I have gained enough experience to help out with writing some new features.
