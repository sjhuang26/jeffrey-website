In Robotics Club, I programmed a relatively advanced robot driving remote control system with a team.

I also cleaned up the code architecture, creating a unified logging system (which we used frequently in debugging issues) and utilities that encapsulate most of the trigonometry and other math involved in driving the robot. While my initial designs were somewhat over-abstracted and inflexible, through iteration and feedback I was eventually able to simplify things.

Most of the robot control code I wrote is still used today, even though I'm no longer in the club.

* Trying as hard as possible to write accurate code, since accuracy is extremely important in the competition.
* Avoiding making code too complicated. Oftentimes I would talk with my teammates on how the code should be written, and they would point out simplifications and other improvements.
