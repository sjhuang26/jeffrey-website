Codotype automates the writing of "template code" in various programming frameworks. I focused on writing the module for React, while my teammates focused on other frameworks such as Vue.

{{% learnings %}}
* This was my first exposure to React, and I learned how it works, proper project structure, and best practices. I worked with someone much older than I was, who taught me many coding tactics that I had never seen before.
* In addition, I learned about the power of templating languages like EJS, which later inspired me to study static site generators such as Jekyll and Hugo.
