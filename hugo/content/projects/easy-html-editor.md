### Overview

**Problem & solution:** Many beginners have trouble bridging the gap between knowing the step-by-step process of a tutorial and the creative process of freely writing their own HTML code. With this in mind, I developed a brief interactive tutorial that is designed to help beginners bridge the gap.

**Tactics of tutorial design used to achieve this goal:**

* sequencing of sections so that beginners can get a minimum foundation to start experimenting with website writing as fast as possible (more advanced concepts are taught later)
* a library of sample code fragments; the user is encouraged to experiment and apply them as building blocks for their own websites
* automatically generated line-by-line explanations of anything the user writes, helping learners gain a better grasp of the full HTML feature-set and fix issues that result.

### Example code

Tutorials contain example code. The code can be copied to the code editor and the user is encouraged to experiment with it.

### Line-by-line explanations

Interactive line-by-line explanations are generated for any code the user enters by clicking "show explanation" in the code editor. When an HTML tag is clicked in the explanation, a definition with examples appears in the bottom panel.

* It's important to make sure that the website layout is reasonably robust to screensize changes and long pages of content. My previous projects often had major layout bugs, so this time I wrote  my own collection of CSS utilities to handle flexbox layout, which is used by marking certain parts of the page as "h-layout", "v-layout", etc. This makes the layout cohere much better.
* I needed to write a clear spec for the project, articulating my ideas clearer than usual.
* Overall, it required careful planning to make sure that the code architecture during the prototyping stages was extendable to a variety of more advanced tutorial features in the future.
