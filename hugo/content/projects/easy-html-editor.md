### Design

The interactive tutorial has a few key features that improve the learning experience:

* Most tutorial pages are self-contained, so the learner can go through the content in their own order, at their own pace
* Each concept has several example codes. The user is strongly encouraged to  experiment with the code to deepen their understanding.
* The app is designed to bridge the gap between understanding the step-by-step process of a tutorial and the creative process of being able to freely write their own HTML code. To this end, the website includes a library of sample code fragments, which the user can apply as building blocks, and line-by-line explanations of anything the user writes. This helps learners gain a better grasp of the full HTML feature-set and fix issues by reading the autogenerated explanation.

### Line-by-line explanations

Interactive line-by-line explanations can be activated for any code the user enters by clicking "show explanation" in the code editor. When a tag is clicked in the explanation, a definition with examples appears in the bottom panel.

* It's important to make sure that the website layout is reasonably robust to screensize changes and long pages of content. My previous projects often had major layout bugs, so this time I wrote  my own collection of CSS utilities to handle flexbox layout, which is used by marking certain parts of the page as "h-layout", "v-layout", etc. This makes the layout cohere much better.
* I needed to write a clear spec for the project, articulating my ideas clearer than usual.
* Overall, it required careful planning to make sure that the code architecture during the prototyping stages was extendable to a variety of more advanced tutorial features in the future.
