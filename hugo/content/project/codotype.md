Codotype automates the writing of "template code" in various programming frameworks. I focused on writing the module for React, while my teammates focused on other frameworks such as Vue.

This was my first exposure to React, and I learned how it works, proper project structure, and best practices. I worked with someone much older than I was, who taught me many coding tactics that I had never seen before.

In addition, I learned about the various applications of templating languages like EJS.
