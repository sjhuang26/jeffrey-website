Codotype is a developer tool for generating frontend and backend boilerplate code. The project is still ongoing.

Currently I have written the module that generates React code; in the process, I learned how to use React. Furthermore, as my team member has several years of job experience, he showed me many best practices for structuring and organizing apps that I had not seen before.
