Easy HTML Editor is an online HTML editor that teaches HTML to beginners. Interactivity, point-and-click, and visualizations will explain code line-by-line and help learners understand code more effectively than tutorials (which canâ€™t explain the current code line by line) and standard HTML editors.

More details can be found in the [specification](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lcrhcePO-ZIB2k28FSUQIIvdViZEv32PejF-ZE7Ztm0/edit).

Most of the important features have been written, but lots of usability testing and refining needs to be done.
