CFS was a web app that allowed college faculty to book rooms in the campus. The previous software for doing this had a difficult user interface and workflow. The project was never completed as the project owner moved on to other ideas.

I wrote the majority (70%) of the frontend code. In its current state, the website can take raw schedule data and create an interactive schedule browser.

This project refined my skills with the Vue frontend framework. Learning Vuex and writing a dynamic schedule display that combined dynamically generated CSS styles and JS data processing was challenging and fun.
